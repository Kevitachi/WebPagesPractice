Info pa CSS y HTML

Pseudo-classes are used in CSS selectors to permit formatting based on information that is not contained in the document tree.
 One example of a widely used pseudo-class is :hover, which identifies content only when the user "points to" the visible element, usually by holding the mouse cursor over it.

Pseudo Elements Selectors
pseudo-element makes a selection that may consist of partial elements, such as ::first-line or ::first-letter. 
Note the double-colon notation for pseudo-elements versus single-colon notation for pseudo-class

Attribute Selectors
The [attribute] selector is used to select elements with specific attribute.
